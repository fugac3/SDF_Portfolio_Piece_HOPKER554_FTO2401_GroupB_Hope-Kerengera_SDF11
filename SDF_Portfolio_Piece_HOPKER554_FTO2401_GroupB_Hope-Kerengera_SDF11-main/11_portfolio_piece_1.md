# Presentation Talking Points

# Slide 1: Introduction

**Talking Points:**
Hello, my name is Hope Kerengera and in this video I will be walking you through the landing page I have created Cache Bank, which is a fictitious banking solution aimed at software developers. This project aimed to test and solidify my knowledge in several key areas of web development including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
To setup this project I cloned the repository onto my local computer, and this contained the starter file and assets. Once I completed the project, I committed my repository and made it public on my GitHub for easy collaboration.

# Slide 2: Component 1 - Project Setup and Responsive Navigation

A mobile-first design approach is one where you design and build a web app for mobile devices first and then adjust for larger screens afterwards. This creates convenience as phones are being used increasingly more than other devices. In this project specifically Tailwind CSS was used to set styles for mobile-first, medium and large screens.

To cater to different screen sizes, a horizontal navigation bar using Tailwind, was created for medium and large-sized screens, which disappears on mobile-devices. On mobile devices a vertical menu exists, which can be toggled open and closed when the burger icon is clicked as a result of JavaScript functions which listens for the click. I also made sure that the nav bar remains in a fixed position at the top so that users can easily navigate to different sections from anywhere on the page.

In the code, I made use of semantic HTML elements such as <nav>, <section> and <footer> instead of <divs> to improve accessibility, readability and meaning.

# Slide 3: Component 2 - Hero and Endorsements

The hero section makes use of two call to actions which immediately catches the users eye because of the bold, green colour:
The first is “Join Cache Now” which is a clear, direct, and striking CTA button that encourages users to sign-up be a part of Cache Bank account.
The second is “Join Our Discord Server” button that links to the bank’s Discord community server where they can find out more about Cache Bank.

To create the hero section, a grid with two columns was used where in the first column a flexbox was used that was arranged into a flex column to place the items vertically below one another, and flex-row was used to place the buttons next to each other. An image was placed in the other grid column.

The next section boldly showcases a list of companies that Cache Bank is endorsed which consists of big, reputable companies such as Amazon and Nike and this not only enhances Cache Bank’s credibility and trustworthiness, but also increases the user’s confidence and trust in the business therefore also their satisfaction with it.

# Slide 4: Component 3 - Features

CSS grids and flexbox was also used for the features section where a grid for 3 columns is used for larger screens, 2 columns for medium screens and 1 column for mobile screens. Within these grids, there are cards that make use of flexbox and flex-columns to display the elements in a column. ARIA was applied by having alternative names for the SVG icons.

# Slide 5: Component 4 - Stats and Getting Started Section

The “Getting Started” section guides the user on how to open an account with Cache Bank in 4 simple steps which are made clearer with different yet consistent bold colours and clear font. To create the statistics animation that counts upwards to the set number, a JQuery was attached to a “countto” ID in the html file.

# Slide 6: Component 5 - Contact and Footer

The bright green colour in the footer creates a visually striking contrast against the rest of the websites white background, which makes it accessible as it is very visible and distinct. The footer also makes use of a flexbox column to display the socials above the copyright and a display flex to place the socials horizontally. The contact section includes links to Cache Bank’s email and location when clicked as a result of anchor tags.

# Slide 7: Conclusion

Overall, I was able to successfully build a user-friendly website for Cache Bank by making use of responsive design and intuitive navigation. My HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and JavaScript knowledge was tested and solidified through the process of building the website.
